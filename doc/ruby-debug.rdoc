== Installing ruby-debug

Because the stock-standard ruby-debug is broken with Ruby 1.9.3, you'll need to run the following to get it to work:

  cd vendor/gems
  gem install linecache19-0.5.13.gem
  gem install ruby-debug-base19-0.11.26.gem -- --with-ruby-include=/Users/<username>/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/include/ruby-1.9.1/ruby-1.9.3-p0/
